How do I solve that with Meteor? For developers like us, this question may happen under the hood more often that we would like! 

But hopefully [The Meteor Chef](http://themeteorchef.com), TMC, teaches you how to solve-day-to-day problems in your Meteor applications. Yeah!

### Cook Meteor with the Chef

The main part of [TMC](http://themeteorchef.com) is a blog updated 3 times a week with three kinds of article:  recipes, snippets and blog articles.

###### Recipes
The recipes are in-depths tutorials that help you implement features, from [building a chat application](https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/building-a-chat-application) (brand new one with Meteor 1.3, yeah!) to [accepting payments with Stripe checkout](https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/payments-with-stripe-checkout) or even [building a blog with React](https://themeteorchef.com/recipes/building-a-blog-with-react/). 

A recipe is a focused on *building a small project*, and the Chef explains you with his unique and enjoyable style the different pain points and why we are doing like this. It's used to take from 1 to 3 hours to complete the tutorial. 

You don't need to start to code from scratch, all recipes starts with [Base](https://themeteorchef.com/base/), a boilerplate designed for getting new projects up and running as quickly as possible.

###### Snippets
TMC gives you access to quick patterns to solve little problems with his snippets. And there are a lot of little problems that can be solved thanks to him... by the time I'm writing there are 54 snippets! Wow! You are able to find almost anything you need here, aren't you?

![Snippets](http://hacklearnmake.com/content/images/2016/03/Capture-d-e-cran-2016-03-16-07-25-24.png)

And as always, it is really well explained, answering the problem step by step, one at a time including the starting point, client side code, server side code. All structured in flowing way to the end where TMC wraps up some takeaways for you to take back home with what you learned hacking with this snippet. What else? 

###### Blog
Blog articles tagged Blog are blog posts (mmmh... meta?) about updates and fun stuff from TMC. It's still in the context of *learning Meteor* with a wider scope than the two other categories.

It provides quality read which invites to reflexion or reaction about developer life, blogging, the future of Meteor. 

If you are into writing & Meteor, don't hesitate to contact Ryan Glover, as known as The Meteor Chef, he recently [called for authors to contribute](https://themeteorchef.com/blog/call-for-authors/)!

###### Weekly digest
And moreover, cause you may not be into connecting to a website every day to see if their some fresh news. What? Facebook? No, no, that's not my point, let's forget that. Whatever, TMC run a weekly digest sent by email on Friday. 

It gives hints on what you can ~~cook~~ learn this week, it worth the subscription!  

### Share your tasty dishes
Coding on his own is cool. Sharing piece of codes or experiences with others is cool & useful. TMC is not just a website: it has a learning philosophy.

In almost every TMC's post, you'll find this: 
>If you get confused or stuck while reading - or just want to talk about Meteor - join us on Slack! [Get an invite now](http://slack.themeteorchef.com/).

Cause yeah, hanging out with other developers in a Slack room can both boost your learning curve and provide fun! You can help people or ask for help on your issues and get in touch with interesting folks you would never have met else. Give it a try, make your own opinion about it and beware of not being overwhelmed by the huge amount of messages!

If you are into paid-coaching, have a look on the [Chef's table page](http://) and ask for help directly to the Chef. In November, Ryan [introduced the Chef's table](https://themeteorchef.com/blog/introducing-chefs-table/): people reading TMC were sending request for coaching service on Meteor. So he opened slots for "two hour, 1-on-1 coaching session with him where we can discuss anything Meteor-related".
